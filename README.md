home-command-server
===================

Home Command Server is a java based server that listens for commands from a home-command-node.  It is meant to allow users to place nodes around their home and control things like lights, music, etc and ask questions using a math module and knowledge-base APIs.  As of the initial import, it works with Philips Hue light bridge and Wolfram Alpha's API. You need to create a user on the light bridge, and create your Wolfram Alpha API key for the properties file.
